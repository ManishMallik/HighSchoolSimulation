# HighSchoolSimulation
This is a game mainly for incoming freshmen in high school, but anyone can play. This game allows people to know what choices they should make to handle their lives in high school. Any choice is a good choice, but there is a choice that would be the best to do, and the player must find out which choice is the best.
